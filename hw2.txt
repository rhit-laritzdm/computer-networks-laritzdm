Oh no! The ROSE-HULMAN.EDU domain expires on 31-Jul-2024.
I sure hope thats not too soon! Good thing I graduate before then.

I'm scared of how the future will have ai robots controlling everything. I must learn to be able to fight back. My first step will be hacking (tracing) hackthissite.org
dig . NS
dig +norec @a.root-servers.net hackthissite.org
dig +norec @d0.org.afilias-nst.org hackthissite.org
dig +norec @j.ns.buddyns.com hackthissite.org
137.74.187.101   137.74.187.100   137.74.187.103 137.74.187.103   137.74.187.104   137.74.187.102

I've made such powerful skills in tracing websites, hopefully the ai robots don't come after me in the future.
I need to be prepared in case the scary ai robots come from Rose-Hulman. To be prepared, I tracked down the IP address of one of Rose-Hulman's (authoritative) name servers. 
nw-408.awsdns-51.com

Hmm, if the ai robots start coming for me, I might have to figure out a way to redirect them.
Some pros of HTTP redirect is that it allows for fine-grain control and selection based on the client IP address. Some cons of HTTP redirect is that it takes extra round trips for a TCP connection, it requires DNS lookups for each new server in the process, and there are overhead costs for the server.
Some pros of DNS redirect are that it doesn't have a TCP set-up delay, DNS caching can reduce overhead, and there is relatively fine control. Some cons are that it is based on the IP address of the local DNS server, there is a hidden load as one DNS response may lead to many machines using the same information (and thus the same server).
I don't know if this is enough, but I'm a little less nervous for when they come.

Please save me,
Nervous Nelly
